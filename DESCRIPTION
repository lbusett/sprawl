Description: Simplify execution of **frequently performed spatial processing tasks** 
  (e.g., reading and writing spatial datasets, extracting statistics from large datasets, etc.) **by 
  providing a single and (hopefully) simpler access point to functionalities spread in the `R` 
  packages ecosystem.** The aforementioned broad objectives are accomplished in `sprawl` by: 
      1. Providing simple **wrappers to common-use functions** for reading/writing spatial data and 
      performing common-use operations; 
      2. Providing **optimized functions for performing some frequently used processing tasks**, by 
      using custom `sprawl` functions or exploiting functions provided by less-known packages;
      3. Optimizing **code execution speed** by providing under-the-hood support for multi-core 
      processing using for example `foreach` looping along raster bands or `raster::MakeCluster` 
      functionality;
      4. Providing **custom functions or workflows for performing more complex processing tasks**, 
      involving the sequential application of different processing steps; 
      5. Simplifying **access and further analysis of processing results**, by carefully formatting 
      processing outputs to easy to use `R` objects.
      6. Providing **custom functions for visualization** of processing results.
