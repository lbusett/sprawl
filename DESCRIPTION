Description: **`sprawl` aims to simplify the execution of some "common" spatial processing tasks** 
  (e.g., reading and writing spatial datasets, extracting statistics from large datasets, etc.) **by 
  providing a single and (hopefully) simpler access point to functionalities spread in the `R` 
  packages ecosystem.** The aforementioned broad objectives are accomplished in `sprawl` by: 
      1. Providing simple **wrappers to common-use functions** for reading/writing patial data ; 
      2. Providing **optimized functions for performing some common-use processing tasks**, often 
      exploiting functions provided by less-known packages; 
      3. Providing custom functions for performing more complex processing tasks; 4. Simplifying 
      access/further analysis of results, by carefully formatting processing outputs to easy to 
      understand and use `R` objects.
