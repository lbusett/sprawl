## Case Study

- You have a categorical raster file, corresponding to a land use map; 
- The file doesn't have an associated RAT (Raster Attribute Table) associating its
values with appropriate labels;
- You want to: 
    1. Associate class names to the original raster; 
    2. Re-classify the raster, to aggregate some classes and set some other classes
  to NoData
    3. Plot the categorical raster, with a proper legend

### Assigning class names  




### Re-categorize the raster




### Plot the result
