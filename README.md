=============================================================

ARCHIVING SPRAWL
-------------------

The package was permanently archived. 
Unfortunately the owner [suddenty passed away](https://docs.ropensci.org/MODIStsp/articles/lorenzo.html), so it is not possible to remove the repository or make it private.
The code was archived in the secondary branches, but please do not use it because it includes functions which basically "wrap" functionalities of several rapidly-changing (and actually changed) packages.
