This Wiki page will provide examples of usage of the main functions included in the `ireaRscripts` package. Functions in the package are meant to provide easy execution of common-use spatial analyses. In some cases, they are therefore just simple wrappers or extensions of functions existing in other packages, for which we thank the autohors of the original packages.
